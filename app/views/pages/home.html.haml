        %p.lead It's often difficult to keep up with a course when you only have a few hours of lectures a week and no day-to-day structure.
        %p.lead This can leave you feeling unmotivated and eventually lead to falling behind on work.
        %p.lead 
          Our application solves this problem by allowing
          %strong.text-primary automated management of your time
          based on the credit weights of your modules, allowing you to focus on the actual studying.
